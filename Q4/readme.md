## Question 4 Analysis
### Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D-Arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- initalize private vars
- loop through rows and cols
- Math.Random()
- dont compare the same cell twice
- return result to break loop
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- constructor
- 2d-Arrays
- looping through rows and cols
- (int)(Math.random()*(Max-Min+1)+Min
