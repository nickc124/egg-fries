## Question 3 Analysis
### Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- constructor
  - initalize private vars
  - build for loop
  - properly build names and rank for list
- method
  - build returning data
  - check for case
  - for loop
  - return data
  
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- for loop
- ArrayList
- looping through ArrayLists
