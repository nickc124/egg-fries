# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Nick Chong*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 5/7/25. 

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- to prep i used the Apclassroom Mcq
- code in java in my free time
- study the tipocs and explore all the edge cases that will show up

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: classes and objects
- Programming practice: coding project using objects to improve coding skills

## Resources

- p5.js (builds skills in a fun and creative way)

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- code more in java and develop logic an coding skills
- build a model based off of puzzle (FRQ Q4)
